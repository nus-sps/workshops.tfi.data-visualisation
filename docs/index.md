## About this eWorkshop {.unnumbered .panelset}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}
<br>
Data is all-powerful; it can make or break scientific theories and cast far-reaching influence on, for example, our beliefs and society. A pertinent example is the use (and misuse) of data in the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. All this has highlighted the need to, at least, teach simple analytical and visualisation skills and tools to gain insights from data.

Python is a friendly, extremely popular and powerful computational language that is free. Python is versatile and can be used for simple visualisation and analytical tasks or even to interrogate big data sets.  This workshop will gently guide you to using Python to visualise data and to make simple statistical queries. This will equip you and your students with a powerful computational tool that can readily be used to gain insight into scientific data. Learning Python will also open other endless computational possibilities (e.g. machine learning, image analysis).

No prior programming knowledge is expected, just lots of enthusiasm and a sense of humour.
