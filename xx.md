# Basics

1. Use `#` to write comments.
2. Python is case sensitive.
3. `x` is not the same as `‘x’`.
4. `=` is not the same as `==`.
5. Be careful about indentaions at the start of a line.
6. Add functionalit by using packages.
7. `.` indicates ownership; there are hidden functions.
8. You can store data as list or numpy arrays.

```
py_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]                  # A Python list
np_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] )      # a numpy array
```
```
np_array[np_array > 4]    # Show me (subset) numbers more than 4
```

9. Access elements of a list using `[2:3]`.
10. Get help by using `?`.


# Pandas

## Basics

1. What is a dataframe?

## Housekeeping 1

1.	How many rows and columns are there?
2.	What are the names of the columns?
3.	Can we look at a sample of the data
4.	What type of data is contained?

7.	How many unique values are there?

## Housekeeping 2: Renaming Stuff

1. Are there any unnecessary columns? Lets drop them!
3. Change values to be nicer?
2. Change column names?

## Housekeeping 3: Missing values
4. How many numbers are missing? What are we going to do with them?
   1. Who missed the tests?
   2. Fill missing numbers
   3. Drop missing numbers
5. Questions (subsetting)
   1. How many major, distributio?
   2. How many females, gender?
