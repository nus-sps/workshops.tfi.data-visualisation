# Core Visualisation Principles


Here we would be covering the Principles of visualization.
Despite the concepts being abstract, one would find it easy to improve their graphical styles in producing plots.

Core visualisation would be different to grasp has it is quite an abstract concept

Here we would try to break down the elements needed to produce the best graphical outputs.

First, one would need to try to abide by the four principles of producing a graph.

- Minimalistic

- Truthfulness 

- Functional 

- Beautiful 

- Inspiring

However, it would be difficult to grasp such concepts without interacting much with the data. 
We would be covering some concepts that have been built on top of the previous sections.



## Truthfulness {-}
`r my_fun.tab('')`

#### Graphical scaling {-}
Here we explore how Kansas Covid data was used to mislead people. Some questions that we can ask is why is the data misleading?

- How does the addition of secondary y-axis change our perception of the data?

- How does restricting the axis boundaries affect how graph generated?

###### Untruthful Graph {-}
```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of misusing graphs to represent wrong data"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core1.PNG')
```

After one can answer these questions, we can generate graph suitable for the audience

###### Accurate Graph {-}
```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of Reinstating graphs to represent right data"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core2.PNG')
```


#### Axis scaled units. {-}

In modern science, we would do two types of plots typically:

- Standard y-x graph

- Logarithmic y-x Plot 

However, nth root relationships between y-x can be done to illustrated below, but take note to adjust the scale of the axis labels to not misrepresent the data.

Some questions when one wants to adjust axis scale:

- How does the changing the scale of the axis tell a better story compared to using a standard y-x graph?

```{r , echo=F, out.width='150%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of Choosing the appropriate scale for graphs"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core4.PNG')
```


## Function  {-}

`r my_fun.tab('')`

Next we would be covering the functional of visualization. 
Here’s a graph on how we would decide what graph should be used after we have done an exploratory plot as suggested in the previous section. 

#### Discrete or Continuous, dots versus bars {-}

One would need to find what graphs would be suitable for Discrete or Continuous data. 
Some questions that we can ask while conducting exploratory plot are:

- Has the data been represented in other sources such as literature ?

- Is the data Discrete or Continuous?

- Is the data better portrayed in certain graphs compared to others?


Once we have answered these, we would attempt to show it in the variety graphs. 
Let’s take COVID-19 exploratory plots for an example.

```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of Deciding what graphs to pick, borrowed from http://sps.nus.edu.sg/~chammika/workshops/viz/#some-practical-considerations"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core5.PNG')
```


#### Organisation {-}

Here we will revisit the COVID-19 bar chart panda examples.
If we were to just plot the data with country, we would first obtain the first graph.

Some points for us to consider when organising data points:

- Does the data portrayed tell any distinctive trends from the graph?

- Can we tell the differences between two similar bars while far apart? 

Organisation helps us answer these question, thus we would first classify the data according to an order, we can sort by the ascending order as illustrated in the graph alone.

```{r , echo=F, out.width='150%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of Organising Data in Bar Charts"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core6.PNG')
```

#### Multiplicative scaling  {-}

Here, we would try to showcase data from the rate of infections in multiple countries. Some questions that we might ask in the graph generation are of the following:

- Does the graph tell much information in 75% of the covered region?

- Would one consider the extreme points of the graph as outliers?

With the help of these questions, we would be able to modify the graphs accordingly with the aid of Axis scaled units.

```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Illustrating the use of a Semi-logarithmic Curve"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core7.PNG')
```

## Aestatics {-}
`r my_fun.tab('')`

Here, this is what would help improve the contrast between the each element

#### Orientation {-}

Here we would continue building on the example from organization, it is often that we would find ourselves wanting to read in a unidirectional path. Thus, the vertical bar chart generated would make it difficult to squeeze horizontal x-axis labels uniformly.

Thus, we would try to ask whether rotation of the graph would make it simpler to read for both an aestatics point of view. Some food for thought questions to ask:

- Does switching the axis between the two variables tell a better picture?

- Would the labels be squeezed badly to illustrate our point?


```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of re-orientating charts to improve its aestatics "}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core8.PNG')
```

#### Size {-}

The next point to consider while generating a plot is the variation of size of elements within the graph.

Using the next two graphical outputs, we would be able to showcase the differences in the role of size labels. 

- Would different size element be distracting in the graph generated?

- Is there a role for these elements?

```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of how label changes improve its aestatics "}
knitr::include_graphics(c('imgs/Core9.PNG','imgs/Core9_1.PNG'))
```




Color is one of the key elements used in to attract audiences directly without dismissing attention.

On the left is a figure produced from a Nature article which includes the 3 of the 4 principles.

It is truthful as it covers the usage of 95 percentage confidence interval of the growth shark eggs which helps the audience of the paper understand how much deviation one would expect from line generated. However, one would find it difficult to interpret the difference in graph seen by the dashed line.
Next we will cover how one would try to attempt to improve such a figure. 

#### Hue, Color Part I {-}

Color is one of the key elements used in to attract audiences directly without dismissing attention. The wrong combination of colors would often create confusion in interpreting the graph pretty easily.

Color comes in two forms, Saturation and Hue. In this section, we will focus on Hue.

In this example, we would be trying to recreate a graph from the first figure of a Nature article listed below with their data, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-79953-0 

The graph generated by the article is decent but we would like to explore ways to minimise distracting elements. Thus, we would aim to answer some questions in how Color affects the graphs produced here.

- How to remove the overlapping regions between plots?

- Can we minimise the affect of different colors in the same graph?

```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of Removing visual clutter"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core10.PNG')
```

#### Saturation, Color Part II {-}

Saturation is another element that one would be able to integrate into the graph without much of a concern. 

One would be able to place emphasis on particular element by dulling the saturation of other elements in the graph.

```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of emphasizing on a single element in the graph"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core11.PNG')
```

#### Color palette, Color Part III {-}

The color palette is one of the most utilised tools on the internet for a notable reason, it helps blend the usage of different colors well.
 
Here are some graphs generated to illustrate the difference in blending colors.

Questions that one would like to ask when tackling the usage of colors are of the following:

- Is there a distinctive contrast between the colors used?

- Would the differences of colors distract your audience easily?


```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of how label changes improve its aestatics "}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core9_2.PNG')
```

 


#### Grid lines {-}

Grid Lines are an important element as they help us gauge the length of the element in both axis. However,they would distract the audience when its use is unnecessary.

Questions that we would have to ask are:

- What role does the grid lines play in gauging the data between points?

- Would the removal of grid lines help us understand the quantitative difference between different elements?

```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of using grid lines to gauge cases between each day"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core2.PNG')
```


```{r , echo=F, out.width='100%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of a pie chart without grid lines"}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Core12.PNG')
```
