# Instructions {.unnumbered}

So, before you come to the workshop, please:

1. Watch the 5 minute video on using Colab for Python.
1. Watch the 15 minute video on 'A Whirlwind Introduction to Python'.
1. Work on the basic exercise.
<!-- 1. Watch the 20 minute video on 'A Whirlwind Introduction to Python'.
