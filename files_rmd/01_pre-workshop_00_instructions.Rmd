# Instructions

We like for you to have learnt some basics about Python and Colab **before** the workshop. This way, we can use the workshop time to focus on more advanced ideas and pay more attention to solving difficulties you might encounter. So,  please **work on the activities given in section [Some Python Basics] before you come to the workshop**. It will take no more than 30 minutes.

if you have any questions or encounter any difficulties please reach out to us through Piazza (see below).

## Start Communicatiing with Us! {.unnumbered}

`r my_logo_piazza`We are going to use the platform Piazza before and during the workshop. This way, you can start to communicate with the instructors and other participants even before the workshop. So, please use the email from Piazza to register and start talking to us!

Please use Piazza for **all** your questions.

::: {.rmdtip}
If necessary Piazza allows you to share Python code.
