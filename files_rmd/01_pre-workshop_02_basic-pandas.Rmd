# The Power of Dataframes

In this day and age of ‘big data,’ it almost an oxymoron to claim that ‘data analysis skills are important, relevant and useful.’ In this section, we will start using Pandas which is Python’s de-facto module for data analysis. In addition to using Pandas you will see how immensely efficient it is to have your data in a dataframe than in a spreadsheet.

## Just enough {-}
Pandas offer several ways (i.e. different syntaxes) to achieve a specific goal. We will not cover all of these. Instead, we will only highlight a minimally sufficient set of syntax and instructions.

To learn the power of Pandas, we will use a dataset of test scores for a dummy class. You can access the data at 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nus-sps/workshops.tfi.data-visualisation/main/files/dummy_class.xls'
