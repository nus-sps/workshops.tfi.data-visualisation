# Exercise for Basic Plotting for Matplotlib
Here we would have some exercises to cover what we have presented in the workshop

## Exercise 1
Here we would begin by plotting a simple graph.
Let's try generating the following graph with black circle markers and Red line

`r my_fun.example('Exercise 1')`
```{python,results='asis',echo=F,cache=F}
from my_functions import render_python
print(render_python('Exercise1.py'))
```
## Exercise 2
Next we would try to add labels to the graph
Referring to the previous page, we can start by assigning three different axis.


`r my_fun.example('Exercise 2')`
```{python,results='asis',echo=F,cache=F}
from my_functions import render_python
print(render_python('Exercise2.py'))
```
