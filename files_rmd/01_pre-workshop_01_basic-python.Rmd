# Some Python Basics

This chapter will quickly introduce you to some basic of Python.
You need to:

1. Watch the 10 minute video in section. and
    - You can access the Colab notebook relevant to the video `r colab_file('link','here')`.
1. Work on the exercises shown below.
    - Here is a template
    - The solution to the exercises can be found `r colab_file('link','here')`.

## A Quick Summary {.unnumbered}

<!-- .rmdnote, .rmdcaution, .rmdimportant, .rmdtip, and .rmdwarning -->

::: {.rmdwarning}

1.  Use `#` to write comments.
2.  Python is case sensitive.
3.  `x`  is not the same as `‘x’`.
4.  `=` is not the same as `==`.
5.  Be careful about indentaions at the start of a line.
6.  Add functionalit by using packages.
    -   E.g. `import numpy as np`
7.  `.` indicates ownership.
    -   E.g. `np.sum()` means the `sum()` function belonging to numpy.
8.  You can store data as list or numpy arrays.
9.  Access elements of a list using `[2:3]`.
10. Get help by using `?`.
