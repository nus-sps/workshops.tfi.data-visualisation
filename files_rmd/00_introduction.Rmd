# Hello

## What topics will we discuss

The Python Universe is **enormous**! We want to share the **minimum** necessary for you to do useful things with Python (while still having fun). So the material on this website is not exhaustive, nor do we want them to be. There are more complete resources elsewhere that you should use for reference. Please refer to [this section](#sec:resources) on resources for more details.

Often there are many ways to use Python to achieve the same result. We will usually share the way that allows you to do the most. We just want to get you started; once you are comfortable, you can explore other more advanced methods of using Python.

## Some Tips

```{r, echo=FALSE}
sn0 <- '^[For example use `Tab` for command completion.]'
sn1 <- '^[For example, Python defines *scope* using a tab.]'
sn2 <- '^[The best way to learn is to teach!]'
```

-   **Remember as little as possible!**<br>Instead have a few good websites (or notes) that you can access easily.
-   **Don't try to remember syntax**<br>Instead try to _understand_ how the syntax is structured`r sn1`.
-   **Experiment! Experiment! Experiment!**<br>Playing with the code does not cost anything. So, be curious. Go with your intuition and try things out. Things won't work so well at te start but it **will**<br>get better.
-   **Keyboard Shortcuts**`r sn0`<br>Using the keyboard makes life _easy_ and more _efficient_. Learn as many as you can.
-   **Don't work alone**<br>Learning is more fun and faster if you discuss and clarify things with a colleague`r sn2`.
-   **Just learn what you need**<br>When starting programming it is better to learn the basics and just what you need to solve your problem.

## Python?

`r my_fun.tab('')`

#### What is Python? {.unnumbered}

`r my_logo_python`Python is a free and friendly programming language. The 'brain' of Python is called an **interpreter**. The newest version of the Python interpreter is **Python 3**.

#### How do I use Python? {.unnumbered}

The Python interpreter can only understand one instruction at a time. Therefore, we usually write many instructions in a single file (code) and then 'pass' it onto the interpreter. These files typically have the extension `.py`. However, Python can also be used interactively using an environment called `r jup`.

One of the best (and easiest) ways to get started with Python is to use an online environment like Colab. However, if want you can also install it on your computer using the **Anaconda distribution** OR installing it locally on your machine without Anaconda!

## Ways to access Python?

`r my_fun.tab('')`

#### Jupyter Notebooks {-}

```{r fig-jupyter-example, echo=F, out.width='75%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Examples of Jupyter Notebooks (from [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org))"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://jupyter.org/assets/jupyterpreview.png')
```

`r my_logo_jupyter` There are many ways to issue commands to the Python interpreter. A `r jup` is one very easy (and very popular) environment to write Python^[or R or Julia] code. `r jup` also allows you to combine  [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and Python in the same document to produce rich content that can be easily converted into reports or even interactive presentation slides!

`r jup` files have the extension `.ipynb`^[`ipynb` stands for *i-python-notebook*].

#### Raw Python {-}
```{r fig-sublime-example, echo=F, out.width='75%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of Code Editor such as Sublime Text."}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Sublimetext.PNG')
```

`r my_logo_python_IDLE` Alternatively, if you want something more simple, you can just install Python (see section below) and use the various code editors to run python code. Python files have the extension `.py`!

Some Pyhton editors that are commonly used include (but not limited to) [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/).

#### Colab {-}

```{r fig-colab-example, echo=F, out.width='75%',fig.align='center', fig.cap="Example of a Colab notebook."}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/Colab.PNG')
```

`r my_logo_colab` **Colab** is a (free) platform offered by Google for coding in Python (and some other languages). Colab offers an environment (almost) identical to `r jup`.

Some advantages of using Colab are:

-   Colab will allow us to use Python without having to install it on our computers.
-   Colab will enable us to share our code with others (just like any other Google document)
-   Colab does all the processing on their servers. So, it won't tax your computer^[Of course you pay the price of computations being slightly slower].

<!-- Let's see what Colab can do by watching their introductory video.<br> -->

### Installing Python


`r my_fun.tab('')`

#### With Anaconda {-}
You **do not** have to install Python locally on your machine for this workshop. However, if you like to have Python on your computer we recommend that you use the Anaconda distribution called **miniconda**.

**Step 1.** Visit the `r link` at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).<br>
**Step 2.** Download and install the 64-bit _Python 3_ distribution suitable for your operating system.<br>(**Windows** users should run Anaconda as **Administrator**)

<!--
##### Updating packages with Anaconda {-}

##### Using Anaconda-Navigator {-} -->

#### Without Anaconda {-}
If you would like to install Python locally on your machine for this workshop or for your own use:

**Step 1.** Visit the `r link` at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).<br>
**Step 2.** Download and install the 64-bit _Python 3_ version (_3.7_ and above is fine) suitable for your operating system.<br>
**Step 3.** Ensure that "Add Python to PATH" option is ticked in the installer!<br>
**Step 4.** Open your favorite editor OR search "IDLE" in your computer to start typing python commands!

##### Installing packages with command prompt {-}
**Step 1.** Open `run.exe` by pressing the windows key AND 'R' key

**Step 2.** Type `cmd.exe` and click "Ok"

**Step 3.** type in `python -m pip install PACKAGE_NAME` and press enter <br>
(replace `PACKAGE_NAME` with the relevant python packages you would like to install.)

<!-- ## Markdown -->

<!-- ### What is Markdown? -->

<!-- `r my_logo_markdown`**Markdown** is a simple, but powerful language for 'word processing'. Markdown is a simple and efficient way to write. Like $\LaTeX$ it tries to separate content from style. You can convert the content of Markdown (`.md`) files directly into PDF or HTML formats. Markdown can be used in `r jup` to add text. You can read more about it at the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). -->

<!-- One of our favorite free, cross-platform Markdown editors is  [Typora](https://typora.io). There are also web based editors ([StackEdit](https://stackedit.io), [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io), [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net), [Markdown & LaTeX Editor](https://upmath.me)). -->

## Conventions

Python code is shown in a grey box like this:

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
print('Code is shown in a box like this')
```

A `#>` will be used to show the result (or output) of the code. This will appear immediately after the code, like this:

```{r, engine='python', eval=TRUE}
print('Code is shown in a box like this')
```
